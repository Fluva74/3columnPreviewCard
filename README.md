Frontend Mentor Challenge 1
So, i am very new to github and im learning this as I go as well. I had a great time putting what I've learned into my first challenge. I hit a lot of snags, but now that this one is done, it seems like it wasn't so hard. I am looking forward to more complex challenges, including figuring out how to document thoroughly on github.
